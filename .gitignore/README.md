# Matlab-Proj
Requires matlab to run the code. 
The stimulus generation program is dichotic1b.  This is a listening task where different tones are sent to both ears. 
For example in one condition, Right-Quiet, tones 2, 3,4 are presented in the Right ear at 50 dB while tones 1,3,5,7 are presented at 70 dB in the Left ear 

The data analysis program is Datadis_ins which tells you the minimum # of blocks to generate listener JF's (i.e., sample data from listener JF is provided here) lowest RMS value and the decision weighting strategy of the listener. 
Datadis_ins includes a function call efficiency to calculate efficiency measures for weighting and internal noise (loss of effiency due to non-optimal weighting strategy).
